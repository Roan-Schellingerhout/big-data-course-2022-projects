- Sometimes the end year is filled in and the start year is empty, seems like the endYear should go into the startYear
- Original title has original language as well --> could deduce language of movie from this
- Accents are sometimes added to the primaryTitle like in: Pássing Fáncy
- no crazy values in years
- some strong outliers on runtime, like 400/500 minutes
- can make a reproduction column
- Around 800 missing values in numVotes (of which I think it is going to be the strongest predictor)
	-> Use datawig to impute the missing values?
	-> Also some large outliers, so ned to remove / scale ? (after inspection)
- there are some duplicates (6) that have the same title and published year --> actually same movie?
